        "\n",
        "When creating recommendation models there are generally two approaches that vary only on the data you use to compute the \"strength\" of a recommendation:\n",
        "- **Explicit ratings**: In this case, each user and product has a star rating attached. Think you might review restaurants in your favorite app.\n",
        "- **Implicit ratings**: In this case each user and product has a rating that is derived from some behavioral metric. Typically that metric is a count, like number purchases of that product or the number of product page views. The actual rating is \"implicit\" in the sense that it is computed algorithmically instead of directly using the value provided.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, you train a model that makes product recommendation based purchase history. For each user and product that appears in the history, you will sum the quantity of items purchased across each transaction. This sum will create an **explicit** rating for the user to product mapping, effectively your model is saying the more of a product a user buys across all transactions, the more relevant it is to that user.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model then goes one step further, and enables you to calculate the recommendations for a user, who may not have bought the product before, but because her purchases are similar to another's, she might like the strongest recommendations inferred from other users like her. Think of this as the algorthim filling in the blanks for the user and a given product, it predicts what that rating should be between them.\n"
